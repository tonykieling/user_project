create heroku account
install heroku locally

# heroku login (inside the app directory)
create an app inside heroku
follow the directions on "Deploy" tab, which basically says to:
# heroku git:clone -a <nameofyourapp>
after that, git add  and git commit normally and
# git push heroku master -> it will deploy your app
create a file called 'Procfile wich will tell heroku what to do. Inside this file write down: `web: node server.js`
in the server.js:
 const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3333;
go to heroku dashboard and run the app


the front end have to be wrapped and hold in public directory inside the app main directory
# npm run build -> it will create a directory called build, inside frontend structure
copy the content of build (frontend) to public (backend)
the server app should be prepared in order to recognize that react is running by:
`
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './public', 'index.html'))
});
`
